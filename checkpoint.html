	 <h2 class = "sections"> Work Done</h2>
	 So I far I have not been able to do much work with the board since I recieved the board thursday April 17th. However in the mean time I read and received several architeture articles.
	 I have only setup a simple circuit where I'm measuring the current with a simple probe however the target is for the current measuring circuit to be done by the weekend.
	 <h2 class = "sections"> Goals</h2>
	 I'm still on track to produce all of my deliverables however a lot my progress depends on how long it takes to setup the current sensing circuit. In addition I have not yet found standard graphics test harnesses and the papers that I have read so far actually implement it themselves.
	 <h2 class = "sections"> Parallelism Competition</h2>
	 For the parallelism competition I plan to demo my power measuring station with an example that stresses the Tegra K1 board. In addition I will have several graphs of previous data that I would have recorded.
	 <h2 class = "sections"> Concerns</h2>
	 The issues that concern me that most are my current sensor setup and its accuracy as well as the test harness that I need to develop. Also I'm concerned about how revelant my results will be since the board runs linux while actual deployment phones will be running andriod.
