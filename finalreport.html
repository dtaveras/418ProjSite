	 <h2 class = "sections"> Overview</h2>
	 **Note that all the code used for the project from the test framework to the studies presented can be found in my github account for which there is a link in the homepage. The final report is organized as follows. First I present the testing harness and discuss what the benefits and failures of my setup were. Then I move on to present the power characteristics of the Tegra K1 in its idle state and the system in the typical state in which I did my studies. The report then goes on to discuss the power characteristics of stressing the cpu and gpu. The sections start with a simple study of what it looks like if the system is using 1 core, 2 cores up until 4 cores. Then I move on to present more specific results based on specific tests that I ran in hopes to discover some anomilies in the power consumption. Finally the last few sections discuss what I have learned, suggestions that I have for those researching power, and my overall take on the project.

	 <div class="comments"> The first step towards implementing the test harness was putting some sort of current measuring device in
	 between the Jetson Tegra K1 power plug. In order to go about this I used the INA219 current sensor which I then plugged into and Arduino and I was able to poll the INA219 chip and use a serial cable connected to my computer to then feed in the current measurements to a QT/C++ GUI that then read and plotted the values. The INA219 sensor measured current to about a 1% percision, that is it was off by (+-) 10mA. It could also measure up to 3.2A but as expected it never had to measure such high currents.</div> <br>

	 <div class="pcomments"> Although I would have preferred not to have had to splice the power brick cord I went over other options
	 	and this seemed like the best option at the time, I also contacted another person doing power measurements on the Tegra K1 to verify the accuracy of my meausurements but he has not gotten back to me yet.</div><br>

	 <div class="pcomments"> The Live plot samples at about 30 Samples per Second. The Tegra K1 has a keyboard and Ethernet connected. In order to do the development I connected to the board via SSH and I also used a keyboard and mouse at times. The live plot also supports saving, you can also change the mode of the plot so that it stores data for the time you run it as opposed to showing you a live view of the power being consumed.</div><br>

	<div class="comments"> **Note that the axis here are ms vs Current, there may be plots which show seconds vs power. Here are a set of plots each one targeting a certain number of cpus stressing and measure the peak current consumed by stressing the system. The tests simply launch threads and constinuously do a set of math operations. I verified that the tests consrespondingly stressed the correct number of CPUs using the gnome-system-monitor.</div><br>

 	<div class="comments"> **Note the two plots here were generated using the Non-Live part of my plot its able to taking data into multiple streams and allow the user to move the graphs to better compare algorithms. This study here was done by implementing Saxpy using arm_neon vector instructions 32bit float 4 wide SIMD, GPU Saxpy using 128 Threads per block, number of blocks depended on the array size, and finally a simple serial version</div><br>
