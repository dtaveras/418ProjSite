	 <h2 class = "sections"> Overview</h2>
	 **Note that all the code used for the project from the test framework to the studies presented can be found in my github account for which there is a link in the homepage. The final report is organized as follows. First I present the testing harness and discuss what the benefits and failures of my setup were. Then I move on to present the power characteristics of the Tegra K1 in its idle state and the system in the typical state in which I did my studies. The report then goes on to discuss the power characteristics of stressing the cpu and gpu. The sections start with a simple study of what it looks like if the system is using 1 core, 2 cores up until 4 cores. Then I move on to present more specific results based on specific tests that I ran in hopes to discover some anomilies in the power consumption. Finally the last few sections discuss what I have learned, suggestions that I have for those researching power, and my overall take on the project.

	 <div class="comments"> The first step towards implementing the test harness was putting some sort of current measuring device in
	 between the Jetson Tegra K1 power plug. In order to go about this I used the INA219 current sensor which I then plugged into and Arduino and I was able to poll the INA219 chip and use a serial cable connected to my computer to then feed in the current measurements to a QT/C++ GUI that then read and plotted the values. The INA219 sensor measured current to about a 1% percision, that is it was off by (+-) 10mA. It could also measure up to 3.2A but as expected it never had to measure such high currents.</div> <br>

	 <div class="pcomments"> Although I would have preferred not to have had to splice the power brick cord I went over other options
	 	and this seemed like the best option at the time, I also contacted another person doing power measurements on the Tegra K1 to verify the accuracy of my meausurements but he has not gotten back to me yet.</div><br>

	 <div class="pcomments"> The Live plot samples at about 30 Samples per Second. The Tegra K1 has a keyboard and Ethernet connected. In order to do the development I connected to the board via SSH and I also used a keyboard and mouse connected to usb ports at times. </div><br>
